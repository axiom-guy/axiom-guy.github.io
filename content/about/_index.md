## Code. Chaos. Coffee. ☕
  
Hey! I’m Aditya — a tech enthusiast 🧑‍💻 who loves building cool stuff 🚀, automating the boring parts, and diving into AI for those satisfying “aha!” moments. I enjoy tinkering with code, organizing chaos, and turning random ideas into neat little projects.

Always learning, sometimes debugging 🐛, and definitely overthinking folder names.
